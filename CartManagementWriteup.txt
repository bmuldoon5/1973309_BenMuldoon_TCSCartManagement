Used to typescript to do most of the work

Added a lot of document.getElementById.innerHTML in order to post my values around the HTML page

Added everything in local storage to get on my checkout page
-used dummy link because I do not think it will send correctly

getElementById.innerHTML allowed it to update on its own

needed to put JSON for localStorage bc needs to be string to read

used bootstrap to make some of the looks 


Pretty much just added up product 1,2,3 and total into their own variables so they are easiler stored into the storage and retreived.
